# Human Motion Model
[MDM: Human MOtion Diffusion Model](https://guytevet.github.io/mdm-page/)

> The MDM framework has a generic design enabling different forms of conditioning. We showcase three tasks: text-to-motion, action-to-motion, and unconditioned generation. We train the model in a classifier-free manner, which enables trading-off diversity to fidelity, and sampling both conditionally and unconditionally from the same model. In the text-to-motion task, our model generates coherent motions that achieve state-of-the-art results on the HumanML3D and KIT benchmarks.
